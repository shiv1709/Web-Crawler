# Web-Crawler
A Web crawler, also be called as Web spider or an automatic indexer.It is implemented here using Java.

How does it works?

You give it a URL to a web page and a word to search for. The spider will go to that web page and collect all of the words on the page as well as all of the URLs on the page. If the word isn't found on that page, it will go to the next page and repeat.
